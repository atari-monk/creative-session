To create a Blender add-on that adds a cube with a Subdivision Modifier to the Add menu, follow these steps:

Create a new text file in a text editor and name it "cube_subdivision.py".

Copy and paste the following code into the "cube_subdivision.py" file: look in file

Save the file and open Blender.

In Blender, go to "Edit" > "Preferences" > "Add-ons".

Click on "Install" and navigate to the location where you saved "cube_subdivision.py". Select the file and click "Install Add-on".

Enable the add-on by ticking the checkbox next to its name in the add-ons list.

Now, when you go to the "Add" menu in Blender (Shift + A), you will find a new category called "Mesh" with an option called "Cube with Subdivision". Clicking on it will add a cube with a Subdivision Modifier, where the default subdivision level is set to 2.

This add-on was created with atari-monk as the author and will be available under the "Add" menu in Blender.
