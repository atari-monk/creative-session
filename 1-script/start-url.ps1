Opening a URL in a new instance of Chrome and placing it on a specific monitor may not be achievable solely through PowerShell. The behavior of opening a new browser instance and positioning it on a specific monitor would typically be controlled by the browser itself or through external tools/extensions.

However, I can provide you with an alternative solution that involves using a third-party tool called "AutoHotkey" along with PowerShell to achieve this functionality. AutoHotkey allows you to automate various tasks, including window manipulation.

Here's an example of how you can modify the previous PowerShell script to open a URL in a new instance of Chrome and position it on a specific monitor using AutoHotkey:

Install AutoHotkey: Download and install AutoHotkey from the official website: https://www.autohotkey.com/

Create a new PowerShell script, e.g., start-url.ps1, and add the following code:

Save the PowerShell script.

Now, you can use the Start-URLWithChrome function to open a URL in a new instance of Chrome and position it on a specific monitor. Specify the URL as the -Url parameter, and optionally provide the monitor index (starting from 1) as the -MonitorIndex parameter. By default, the function will position the window on the first monitor.

This script dynamically generates an AutoHotkey script that activates the Chrome window and moves it to the desired monitor using the WinMove command. The AutoHotkey script is saved to a temporary file, executed using the AutoHotkey executable, and then cleaned up afterward.

Note: The script assumes that the AutoHotkey executable (AutoHotkeyU64.exe) is in the system's PATH. If it's located in a different directory, you may need to modify the $ahkExe variable in the script to point to the correct path.
